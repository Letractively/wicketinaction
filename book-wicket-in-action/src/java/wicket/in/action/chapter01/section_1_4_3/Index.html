<h3><a wicket:id="listing01" href="#">Listing 1: the sample html</a></h3>
<p>Shows the static version of the markup files. Note that the links 
    won't work, as the markup has to be read from the classpath, and the
    default behavior of application servers is 'not to look there'.</p>

<h3><a wicket:id="listing02" href="#">Listing 2: adding the link</a></h3>
<p>Adds the links to both pages and points them to one another.</p>
